express:"^4.19.2" :- ^ means auto update for all version if I don't use then that version is locked for all time.

if i have to work on a project so major should be the same if isn't then my program will not work 
package-lock.json==tells which version uses

in the routing : if there is multiple route then at the top route will run only rest is usseless.
like if  we use "/" then only / wali route hi chalegi..& /hello wali aur /test wali nhi chalegi
it run when there is a matching word.



by default whenever you write an URL on the top of the browser that makes a GET API call.
browser are the wrost method to test URL,to test your route ,to test your backend.


for the testing API we use Postman .


for the remember:-
app.use("/user,()=>{
 res.send("route handler 1");
})

so see; if you use app.get - handle all get req
if app.post- handle all post request
if app.use- handle all method


middleware =>{
    mainly we use middleware for authorization like login,aur signin etc.. it ensures that
    user is authorized or not..
}

if your cnnection is not establish then go to mongodb.atlas and add the current ip address then 
your connection with database will smoothly establish..


*our sever can not read  JSON data directly, for the reading we use middleware which convert json data into javasript for the readable form 
for this, we use express.json middleware 

feed API- get all the users and all documents 

required :true check this attribute should be present in database 
like, firstname : string,
      required: true, it means firstname can't be skip

unique ensures that same attribute(emailId) cannot insert to the database
you cannot create another userId with same emailId
